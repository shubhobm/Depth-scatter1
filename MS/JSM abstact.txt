Title:
Robust estimation of principal components from depth-based multivariate rank covariance matrix

Abstract:
Analyzing principal components for multivariate data from its spatial sign covariance matrix (SCM) has been 
proposed as a computationally simple and robust alternative to normal PCA, but it suffers from poor
efficiency properties and is actually inadmissible with respect to the maximum likelihood estimator.
Here we use data depth-based spatial ranks in place of spatial signs to obtain the orthogonally
equivariant Depth Covariance Matrix (DCM) and use its eigenvector estimates for PCA. We derive
asymptotic properties of the sample DCM and influence functions of its eigenvectors. The shape of these influence functions indicate good efficiency
properties compared to the SCM. Finite sample simulation studies show that principal components
of the sample DCM are robust with respect to deviations from normality and infinitesimal contaminations,
as well as are more efficient than the SCM.
