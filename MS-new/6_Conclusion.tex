In the above sections we introduce a covariance matrix based on depth-based multivariate ranks that keeps the eigenvectors of the actual population unchanged for elliptical distributions. We provide asymptotic results for the sample DCM, its eigenvalues and eigenvectors. Bounded influence functions as well as simulation studies suggest that the eigenvector estimates obtained from the DCM are highly robust, yet do not lose much in terms of efficiency. Thus it provides a plausible alternative to existing approaches of robust PCA that are based on estimation of covariance matrices (for example SCM, Tyler's scatter matrix, D\"{u}mbgen's symmetrized shape matrix).
